# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [] - 1970-01-01

### 🚀 Features


- *(plotting)* All simulation plots can now be done via plutonlib.plot.plot_sim()

type of plot\colourmap is determined in cmap_base

- *(Plotting/Analysis)* added graph_peaks() to find graphical peaks with scipy

is buggy for stellar_wind, is used with peak_findr() to plot radius increase across time with plot_jet_prog()


### 🐛 Bug Fixes


- *(Plotting)* simplified plotting, all done with plot_sim() now

sim_type determines which branch of cmap_base() to add into plot_sim(), added subplot_base() (axis,fig), plot_label(), plot_save() as helper functions

## v0.2.0 (2025-04-03)

### BREAKING CHANGE

- all previous plot_...() functions have been replaced by plot_sim()

### Feat

- **Plotting/Analysis**: added graph_peaks() to find graphical peaks with scipy
- **plotting**: All simulation plots can now be done via plutonlib.plot.plot_sim()
- find graphical peaks w graph_peaks(), used with peak_findr() to plot radius against time w plot_time_prog()

### Fix

- **Plotting**: simplified plotting, all done with plot_sim() now

## [v0.1.1] - 2025-04-01

### 🚀 Features


- *(general)* added  PlotData class for easier plotting, fix: removed some plotting functions, now plot_cmap_2d -> plot_jet_profile
