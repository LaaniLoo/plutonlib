is buggy for stellar_wind, is used with peak_findr() to plot radius increase across time with plot_jet_prog()


### 🐛 Bug Fixes


- *(Plotting)* simplified plotting, all done with plot_sim() now

sim_type determines which branch of cmap_base() to add into plot_sim(), added subplot_base() (axis,fig), plot_label(), plot_save() as helper functions
