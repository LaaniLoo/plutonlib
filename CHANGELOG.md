# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## v0.2.3 (2025-04-07)

### Fix

- **load.py**: added sel_prof in pluto_load_profile()

## [v0.2.2] - 2025-04-04

### 🐛 Bug Fixes


- *(Changelog)* using git-cliff



### Other


- *(general)* version 0.2.1 → 0.2.2


## [v0.2.1] - 2025-04-04

### 🐛 Bug Fixes


- *(Plotting)* fixed labelling of xy and titles

added different title assignment for sim_types in plot_extras(), "stellar_wind" has its title element as a list where: title_other = [[title_L,title_R]]


### Other


- *(general)* version 0.2.0 → 0.2.1


## [v0.2.0] - 2025-04-03

### 🚀 Features


- *(plotting)* All simulation plots can now be done via plutonlib.plot.plot_sim()

type of plot\colourmap is determined in cmap_base

- *(Plotting/Analysis)* added graph_peaks() to find graphical peaks with scipy

is buggy for stellar_wind, is used with peak_findr() to plot radius increase across time with plot_jet_prog()


### 🐛 Bug Fixes


- *(Plotting)* simplified plotting, all done with plot_sim() now

sim_type determines which branch of cmap_base() to add into plot_sim(), added subplot_base() (axis,fig), plot_label(), plot_save() as helper functions


### Other


- *(general)* version 0.1.1 → 0.2.0


## [v0.1.1] - 2025-04-01

### 🚀 Features


- *(general)* added  PlotData class for easier plotting, fix: removed some plotting functions, now plot_cmap_2d -> plot_jet_profile

## [] - 1970-01-01

### 🐛 Bug Fixes


- *(load.py)* added sel_prof in pluto_load_profile()

can load a specific profile rather than selecting via user input, now displays profiles that only contain plottable vars, e.g. no x3 for Jet in cyl
